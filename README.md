# leveraging-spec
Introduction to `clojure.spec.alpha`, a library available in Clojure 1.10.x to define specifications for functions and data.

Function calls can be checked against specifications for arguments, return values and relationships between both.

Specifications can be defined for expected data types and data structures, ensuring correctness of data especially around the boundaries of the system.

## Usage
Open the project in a [Clojure aware editor](http://practicalli.github.io/clojure/development-tools/), run a REPL and evaluate the code to better understand how to use `clojure.spec.alpha`.

The design journal namespaces show how parts of the project have been developed over time.

See the [Practicalli study guide Spec playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpr9V-R8ZxiBWGAuncfBRYhZtY5-Bp75s) for a video walk through of this project.
